![Many ways](./manyways.jpg)

Most advice on problem-solving is about, well, solving problems. For example, my favorite one is about the design process from Jon Bentley’s _Programming Pearls_:

> Work on the right problem.  
> Explore the design space of solutions.  
> Look at the data.  
> Use the back of the envelope.  
> Exploit symmetry.  
> Design with components.  
> Build prototypes.  
> Make tradeoffs when you have to.  
> Keep it simple.  
> Strive for elegance.

This is how we introverts solve problems. Sometimes we have no choice but to solve a problem from scratch. **Other times, a better solution can be found externally**, this is usually an extrovert’s thought pattern.

For example, if we need to integrate with an external system that sends out data through a raw TCP connection. As introvert problem solvers, we instinctively ponder on “what technology should we use to solve this?”, “Java NIO or Netty?” , “What are the pros and cons of these technologies?” Even though we manage to implement this, the cost of dev time and maintenance could not be low.

An extrovert’s thought maybe along the lines of “Why do they provide this raw protocol?”, “Do they have other alternative protocols?”, “Can we negotiate with the other company to provide higher-level protocols like MQTT or AMQP?” Obviously, problems can be solved effectively this way.

Other than accepting and solving a problem right away, we often can ask for resources or negotiate a better alternative solution. As Tom Duff said, “Whenever possible, steal code”, if that doesn’t work, we know it’s time to follow Jon Bentley’s advice.
